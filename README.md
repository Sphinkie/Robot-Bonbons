# Robot à Bonbons
---
## Description
A small robot used for the children birthdays, to distribute candies.
## Installation
The sketch has to be uploaded into an Arduino board.  
Fill the tank with round shaped candies.
## Usage
Approach your hand from the detector: the robot will emit some blips (like D2R2) and a candy will roll down to the basket.  
With the rear button button, you can choose different colors for the side light.
