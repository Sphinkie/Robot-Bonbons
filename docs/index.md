# Robot à Bonbons

An Arduino-based and *papier-maché* robot will distribute candies during birthday parties.  

**Approach your hand** from the detector on the right side, the robot will emit some D2R2-like blips and a candy will roll down to the basket.  

With the **rear button**, you can choose different colors for the side light.

## Tuning

Maintain your hand *during 1 second* very close of the detector (1 to 4 cm), and the robot will enter in the ***adjustment mode***. The motor will turn slowly until it reach its correct initial position.
You can adjust the rotation speed with the rear button.
