# New Tone library

About 1,200 bytes smaller code size than the standard _tone_ library.  
Faster execution time.  
Exclusive use of port registers for fastest and smallest code.  
Higher quality sound output than _tone_ library.  
Plug-in replacement for Tone.  
Uses timer1, which may free up conflicts with the _tone_ library.
